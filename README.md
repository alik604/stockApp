# stockApp
> Stock watch list and simulator, 15 min delayed pricing. Analyze n stocks, 2 graph per stock. Has Technical Indicators and will have some Machine Learning based predictors. Supports American stock markets, and limited ETFs

## Depreciation

This project was a fun way to learn everything I would need for an internship in web development, matter in fact, I likely got my first two offers because of this project. This was during my second year  (44/120 credits) mark. 

Now I have a Notebook running on google’s Colab for analyzing many stocks in minutes, it is much easier to maintain and more Machine Learning friendly... and no API restriction due to web scraping. 

## About 

Stock market simulator is built on the MERN stack, does supports only Technical Analysis 

- VWAP, SMAs, EMAs, CCI

This app allowed me to analyze N number of stocks at a time, with 2 graphs per stocks,
resulting in me going through my watchlist about 30% faster

Since the objection was personal use, I have yet to deployed, or add log-in support on the frontend. I did however, learn how to build in login function to both ends. I am not interested in “complementary pentests” from prospective employers. I do not want to be entrusted user passwords  

I have avoided the use of redux (I call that a plus)

### Refection

>  As a predicted my first Internship was in Information Security.    

## Outcome(s)

I've achived my goal for this project. I'll use it as a tool to quickly view ~50 stock periodically.
