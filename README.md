# stockApp

Stock watchlist and simulator MERN stack, does not support fundemental and technical analysis data ( i can add technical data, but I do not use it. i doubt others will... why waste the time. im not doing the VWAR and P-SAR calculations for "fun". not to mention the api call resitrcation 5 per min) 

Its aug 30th. I have two small items to fix. stat+sumary, and fix a bug thats does not show items till form is typed on. i have 2 days till my due date. 

I have yet to deploy, add log in screen frontend, and make this multi page (for search function) 
idk how to make multiscreen yet. i seem to have avoided the use of redux (i call that a plus)

### in progress (aug 30th on hold)
im too stupid to merge a branch with the master, yes i tried SO. (on aug 16th)
## Branch is current.



## first 1/3 of this year i spent on android. secound 1/3 i spent on MERN (with little angular). last 1/3 ill spend on machine learning and data science

### final project for that will be to use tensorflow.js (or maybe brain.js) for stock predictions, and that will be appended into this. goal is jan 3rd 2019
