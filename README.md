# stockApp The aug 13 Branch is current

Stock watchlist and simulator MERN stack, does not support fundemental and technical analysis data ( i can add technical data, but I do not use it. i doubt others will... why waste the time. I'm not doing the VWAP and P-SAR calculations for "fun". not to mention the api call resitrcation 5 per min) 

Its aug 30th. I have two small items todo/fix: stat+sumary, and fix a bug thats does not show items till form is typed on. I have 2 days till my due date. 

I have yet to deploy, add log in screen frontend, and make this multi page (for search function) 
idk how to make multi page yet. I seem to have avoided the use of redux (I call that a plus)


# Currently on hold. I've achived my goal for this project. Ill use it as a tool to quickly view ~50 stock periodically.
## if I figure out how to make this multi page, I'll do so and do some brushing up. 
### I still can not merge the aug 13 branch with the master, yes i tried stack overflow (on aug 16th). The aug 13 Branch is current.



--- note to self. keep an eye out for a 'pretty' way to reorder watchlist ---

## First 1/3 of this year I spent on android. Secound 1/3 I spent on MERN (with little angular). Last 1/3 I'll spend on machine learning and data science

### Final project for that will be to use tensorflow.js (or maybe brain.js) for stock predictions, and that will be appended into this. goal is jan 3rd 2019
