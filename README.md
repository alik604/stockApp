# stockApp
> A stock market simulator with 15min delayed pricing. Supports American stock markets, and limited ETFs and ETNs.

## About 
Stock market simulator is built on the MERN stack, does not support fundemental and technical analysis data (VWAP and P-SAR calculations are not "fun". Not to mention the api calls are restrictioned to 5 per min) 

On aug 30th. I have two small items todo/fix: stat+sumary, and fix a bug thats does not show items till form is typed on. I have 2 days till my self imposed due date. 

I have yet to deploy, add log in support on the frontend.
I have avoided the use of redux (I call that a plus)

## Outcome(s)

I've achived my goal for this project. I'll use it as a tool to quickly view ~50 stock periodically.
