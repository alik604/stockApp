## stockApp is a stock market simulator with 15min delayed pricing. Supports American stock markets, and limited ETFs and ETNs.
### The aug 13 Branch is current (Issues mergings barnch and master) 

stock market simulator is built on the MERN stack, does not support fundemental and technical analysis data (VWAP and P-SAR calculations are not "fun". Not to mention the api calls are restrictioned to 5 per min) 

on aug 30th. I have two small items todo/fix: stat+sumary, and fix a bug thats does not show items till form is typed on. I have 2 days till my selfemposed due date. 

I have yet to deploy, add log in screen frontend, and make this multi page (for search function).
Idk how to make multi page yet. It seems that I have avoided the use of redux (I call that a plus)


## I've achived my goal for this project. I'll use it as a tool to quickly view ~50 stock periodically.

### I still can not merge the aug 13 branch with the master, yes I tried stack overflow (on aug 16th). The aug 13 Branch is current.



--- note to self. keep an eye out for a 'pretty' way to reorder watchlist ---

## First 1/3 of this year I spent on android. Secound 1/3 I spent on MERN (with little angular). Last 1/3 I'll spend on machine learning and data science

### Final project for that will be to use tensorflow.js (or maybe brain.js) for stock predictions, and that will be appended into this. goal is jan 3rd 2019
